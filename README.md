# Destination Checker

<p> This was initially just a weather app project that I built into an automated search tool, tapping into 4 different API's to help research and check potential destinations I want to travel to.<br>
API's used:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Open Weather Map</strong> </a>- To Fetch the
        Weather.</li>
    <li><strong>YouTube</strong> - To show travel guide videos of the destination. The video opens on top of the content, I used FancyBox for this.</li>
    <li><a href="https://opencagedata.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Open Cage Data</strong></a> - Geolocation (to
        convert the user's coordinates (lat & lon) into the city they are in).</li>
    <li><a href="https://source.unsplash.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Unsplash </strong></a> - To dynamically pull in
        an image of the city searched, for inspiration.</li>
    <li><strong>Wikipedia </strong> - To bring up relevant articles related to the destination searched.</li>
</ul>
